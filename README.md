# Shoplist 2

Shopping web companion created using React.js. It's my first project made in this library and revamped after 1 year of experience gained at my first work as a frontend developer.

## Description

Create editable lists and store them in web browser. Add and edit items, clear all items, save or load lists from menu.
Now DARK MODE included! ðŸŒš

## Known bugs

- cross out style moves to the next list item when the one above is removed
